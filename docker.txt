1-Add Jenkins User to Docker Group:
Add the Jenkins user to the Docker group to grant it permission to access the Docker daemon socket. You can do this by running the following commands:
sudo usermod -aG docker jenkins
sudo systemctl restart docker
sudo systemctl restart jenkins

2-Adjust Docker Socket Permissions (Less Secure):
Another approach, though less secure better to use the  approach if possible.

sudo chmod 666 /var/run/docker.sock
sudo systemctl restart jenkins
